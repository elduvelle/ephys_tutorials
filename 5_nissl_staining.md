**NOTE: This is called the 'fast Cresyl Violet staining'. It is fast, but might not be as pretty as other methods.

#### 0. Cresyl Violet recipe

| Ingredients for |	100 ml| 400ml|
|--|-------|------|
|Cresyl fast violet acetate|	0.1g|	0.4g|
|Glacial Acetic Acid| 5ml	|20ml|
|Distilled water| 100ml|	400ml|

- (optional) Heat
- stir (for 4+ days [is this necessary?])
- filter

*TIP: always filter pre-use*

#### 1. Material needed
- Uncovered brain slides
- 1 or ideally 2 slide holders (with a handle)
- Staining Wells
- Staining solutions: Cresyl Violet, Distilled water, 70% / 90% / 100% EtOH (in distilled water), Histoclear
- Gloves, gown, hood
- cover medium/ glue (e.g. DPX)
- coverslips
- paper towels
- timer

#### 2. Preparation
- *(optional; the day before)* stir the Cresyl Violet solution
- *(optional)* Filter the Cresyl Violet solution before use
- Fill the wells with the appropriate solutions and arrange them in order. The two histoclear wells should be under a hood.

#### 3. Staining
- Choose which slides to stain and place them in the slide holder. The first batch should ideally be a test with unimportant slides.
- Leave the slides in each well for the given duration:

| solution | duration |
|----------|----------|
|Cresyl violet|		6-12 min|
|dH20 1|	1 min|
|dH20 2|	1 min|
|70% EtOH|		30s|
|95% EtOH|		30s|
|100% EtOH|		20-10s|
|Histoclear 1|		1 min|
|Histoclear 2|	1 min â€“ until gluing|

*TIP: Leave longer in Cresyl if not staining enough*  
*TIP: change the first dH2O solution regularly, possibly after each batch*  
*TIP: Leave longer in 100% EtOH if overstaining*
*TIP: if your slices are detaching / curling from the slide, it probably mean the slice does not stick well enough to the slide, try to get positively charged slices ("Superfrost plus") or gelatinized slides*

- Glue coverslips using DPX:
  - take 1 slide out of the Histoclear 2
  - use thin paper to dry the back and excess solution
  - drop 1 think line of DPX / glue
  - gently place the coverslip on top
  - very gently press on the coverslip to push any bubbles out
  - dry excess glue, set slide aside to dry
  - repeat for all slides in Histoclear

- Adjust the times in Cresyl and 100% alcohol and do remaining batches.

#### 4. Clean-up
- Filter Cresyl, place in 'used cresyl' container. It can be reused many times.
- discard the dH2O and clean the wells
- make sure the alcohol and histoclear solutions are in hermetically closed containers (they can be reused many times), or cover them with parrafin film to avoid evaporation
- clean & tidy the space
- ideally wait a few hours for the covered slides to dry before looking at them under a microscope.
