### 1. (Probably) the best lesion parameters, from Anna Gillespie (thank you for sharing!)

- Lesions are performed 24h before perfusion (under isoflurane anaesthesia)
- Lesion parameters: 30 Î¼A of positive current for 3 s, on 2-4 channels per tetrode
- after 24h, proceed with perfusion (PBS followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1M PB)
- leave the entire skull in PFA for 24h with the tetrodes still inside the brain
- after additional 24h, pull tetrodes up and remove brain

This is how it _should_ look like:

lesions method actually described in: [Sosa et al., 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627319310086)

This is how it looks like when I do it (tried 2s of stimulation for some tetrodes, but couldn't see those lesions at all, so definitely use 3s):

### 2. alternative device to make lesions

**Warning: the red light should be on the right, unlike in the photo!**  

method:

|parameter |value   |
|----------|--------|
|power:    |on      |
|audio:    |on      |
|mode:     |unipolar|
|DC/test:  |hold ON position during the lesion     |
|range:    |100uA|
|% range:  |e.g. 30 (for 30 uA)|
|Polarity select:| red light on right/red for positive current|
|Output:   |on|

Red output = contacting channel to lesion  
Black output = connected to drive ground, grounded part of cone, or, alternatively, rat skin via a saline-imbibed tissue
