#### 1. Material needed
- 1 Frozen brain (-80°C) that was in 20% or 30 % sucrose in PB(S) solution, kept in foil
- 1 brush to collect slices
- 1 microtome blade
- dry ice (quite a lot)
- plastic wells to collect good slices with PB(S)
- container for discarded slices
- some PB(S) solution
- OCT / mounting medium

#### 2. Preparation
- brain preparation: transfer the brain from the -80°C Freezer to a warmer freezer (-20°C)
- microtome:
  - make sure the device is clean, if not, clean with 70% EtOH and dry it.  
  - check the slicing width (I use 40 um)  
  - lower the base so that you'll have enough space for the brain to stand up without being cut yet  
  - check if the base is flat (using a level), if not, adjust it using the two knobs (unlock with the handle first)  
  - start packing the base with dry ice, all around it but **not** on the brain-holding part (it might create air pockets when warming which will prevent proper brain attachment). Make sure to compress the dry ice and add as much as possible.
  
  *TIP: From now on, regularly replenish the dry ice to keep the base cold.*

- brain installation:
  - with a scalpel or razor blade, cut the cerebellum to make a flat surface that will support the brain.
  - *Get ready for the next step as it is quite crucial to get it right*
  - drop a bit of OCT in the middle of the (now cold) base, IMMEDIATELY take the brain and place it, upwards, in the OCT, until it stays in place standing straight.
  - add more OCT to surround the brain, starting from the tip. Not too much as it might keep the brain too cold, but enough so that the brain is properly held and will stay even during slicing!
  - add a foil tent around the brain to help cooling down.
  - If the tip doesn't cool down fast enough, spray a bit of freezing spray.
  - Ensure that your brain will stick to the base by adding some more OCT at the bottom.

- blade installation:
  - take blade out of box, clean it with 70% Ethanol, dry it
  - place it in the blade slot of the microtome, making the end flush on the right side, lock it in with the two screws
**TIP & Warning: Make sure to slide the blade protection ON whenever you're not using the blade!**

- Remember to regularly add dry ice if needed from now on.

#### 3. Slicing

- Start of slicing:
  - ensure that the blade goes above the brain when pulling it towards you.
  - either by doing mock slicing movements (if needed, you can increase the slicing width by pulling the blade several times past the click then back before pulling all the way), and/or by raising the base, get the brain to be just below the blade level.
  
*TIP: Do not do too many 'width increases' at the same time. 4-6 max recommended before you pull all the way.*

  - start slicing. At this stage slices should probably be discarded: collect each slice individually from the blade and leave it either on a discarding filter on in a PB(S) well. I prefer the filter.
  - if needed, put a little bit of PB(S) on the top of the blade to help slices stay there.
  - Use these first slicing steps to make final adjustments to the base levelling, ideally using brain landmarks.
 
- Actual slice collecting:
  - for the brain region(s) of interest, instead of discarding the slice, collect it and leave it in your PBS well. Remember to note the slice collection rate (e.g. 1 out of 10, 1 out of 2, etc.) on the well box as well as the slice width.
  - if the slice curls up, it means the brain is a bit too cold: wait a bit. Having less OCT around the brain helps with this.
  - slicing not too fast but not too slow should give you the best results (: 

*Tip: it is easier to warm up (just wait) than cool down! Always replenish your dry ice when needed!*

#### 4. Clean-up

- Stop replenishing the dry ice and collect what is left (keep it for the next person if you want).
- Remove the blade, clean it with 70% EthOH, **dry it**, oil it (1 stripe along mid-height on both sides should be enough, place it back in its box
- Make sure your base is flat while the cut brain is still there, if not you could adjust it for the next person.
- Move the base back down with the handle on the left.
- Remove the brain, discard it in the freezer bin with the other discarded slices
- Spray the base with 70% EtOH to get rid of the remaining dry ice, dry it
- Clean up everything else that you used.
- Cover the microtome to avoid dust (*The Enemy [TM]*)
