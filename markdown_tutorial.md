## What is this?
A quick tutorial on how to use Markdown on GitHub, for example to format your readme files!  
Written in parallel to the Markdown on Mastodon tips that can be found [there](https://neuromatch.social/@elduvelle/109628712961958917)

### 1. Make a title  
by starting a new line with # , ## , ### etc. (don't forget the space after the #)

## Example of level 2 title (actually starts with "## ")

### 2. Make a list 
by starting a new line with "-"
- like
- this
  - they can also be indented if starting with some spaces 
  - yes, these are all just starting with a dash
  1. if you start these with numbers then it becomes a numbered list of the appropriate level (this actually starts with "1. ")
  1. and this also starts with "1. " but the numbered lists are automatically incremented

### 3. Add a link to text
See [this](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started) for a pretty complete Markdown explanation [typed as "[this]" immediately followed by (the link in parentheses)]  
Also [here](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/lesson/1/) for a **very nice** Markdown do-it-yourself tutorial! 

### 4. Format text
write in **bold** by surrounding a word with "**" on each side  
write in *italics* with just one "*" on each side
> Quote text by adding a ">" at the start of the paragraph!  

want to highlight some `code`? surround it with "`"  
strikethrough ~text~ using "~"  

### Additional tips:
- make good use of the 'Preview' feature at the top of your editing window in GitHub
- you might have to add 2 spaces at the end of each line of a paragraph to avoid having them all on the same line  
- AFAIK you cannot underline in the Markdown used here on github    
- most of this also works on Slack!!
