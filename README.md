## Documents related to tetrode electrophysiology for neural data recording


Will attempt to store here useful tutorials and other documents related to electrophysiology using tetrodes. 

### Table of contents:
1. Lesion-making technique to mark the tips of tetrodes for histology ([pdf](https://github.com/elduvelle/ephys_tutorials/blob/main/Tutorial%20for%20tetrode%20electrolytic%20lesions.pdf))
    - let me know if you'd like to update it with parameters of your choice!
2. Collaborative hyperdrive parameters list ([google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_RQzEL3dPUSTLOz9AyFzJbuIaXmG7jZLt3z06Fllemc/edit#gid=0))
    - feel free to contribute by adding a row!
